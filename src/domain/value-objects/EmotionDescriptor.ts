 *
 *   - a leading MOOD word that fixes the emotional valence (joyful vs.
 *     melancholy vs. menacing) — this is what keeps neighbours apart;
 *   - a TONAL / ENERGY anchor (major vs. minor key, slow vs. fast) the model
 *     interpolates between when two emotions are mixed;
 *   - a signature INSTRUMENT / TEXTURE so blends layer instead of mush.
 *
 * The pairs that previously overlapped are now separated on purpose:
 *   - sad vs. calm: sad is `mournful` + `minor key` (sorrow); calm is `serene`
 *     + `peaceful` with no minor tonality (rest, not grief).
 *   - angry vs. hype: angry is `dark` + `menacing` distorted guitars (negative);
 *     hype is `euphoric` festival electronica (positive).
 *   - happy vs. hype: happy is warm `acoustic` `upbeat pop`; hype is `driving
 *     electronic` with `punchy bass` at a faster tempo.
 *
 * Common blends are intentional by construction, e.g. happy + a touch of sad =
 * bittersweet: major/minor tonality becomes ambiguous while the acoustic
 * guitar, solo piano and strings sit in one coherent ensemble.
 *
 * Sets are kept tight (≈5 terms) so no single emotion's joined prompt becomes a
 * word-salad that drowns out the others in a mix.
